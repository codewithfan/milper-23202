1. Expiration. This MILPER message will expire 30 May 2024 or upon the release of updated policies and AR 600-81.


2. All Soldiers must begin the TAP process NLT 365 days before the date of their anticipated transition from active duty. The following timelines apply to the discharge or release from active duty of an eligible Service member during key touch points in the TAP Military Life Cycle (MLC).

a. In the case of an anticipated retirement, TAP may begin as soon as 24-months prior to retirement, but NLT 365 days before the requested separation date. An approved retirement date is not required and a request for retirement will suffice as long as the PAR is complete in IPPS-A.

b. In the case of a separation other than a retirement, TAP should begin during the 13-18 month period prior to the anticipated separation, but NLT 365 days before the separation date annotated in IPPS-A.

c. In an unanticipated separation or retirement, or in the event a member of any Reserve Component is demobilized under circumstances in which prescribed timelines cannot be met, transition assistance must begin as soon as possible within the remaining period of service or the effective date on the DD Form 214. Service members must meet all Career Readiness Standards (CRS) or receive a warm handover to the appropriate interagency partners or local resources prior to transition.

d. All transitioning Service Members may register in person at their local TAP Center, Online or visit the TAP Virtual Center utilizing the online Self-Assessment. https://portal.armytap.army.mil/


3. TAP Virtual Center (VC) procedure.

a. If isolated or geographically separated (greater than 50 miles from any military installation offering TAP services), clients can use the 24/7 TAP VC. If located on an installation with a TAP center, the client is required to obtain transition services via the TAP center on the installation.

b. To register for TAP virtual classes, call the TAP VC at 1-800-325-4715 or email usarmy.knox.hrc.mbx.tagd-tap-virtual-center@army.mil .


4. Career Readiness Standards waiver.

a. TAP Counselors will determine whether Soldiers may receive a CRS waiver, based on their individual self-assessment/Individualized Initial Counseling (IIC). Counselors will document waivers on the DD Form 2648 (eForm). This discretionary authority does not exempt Soldiers from IIC, pre-separation counseling, Army Transition Day, VA Benefits and Services Brief, or the DOL One-Day Workshop, unless the Soldier meets the DOL One-Day Workshop exemption criteria. The two-day career track is waivable, dependent on tier level determined during the IIC.

b. If CRS requirements were met at any time during the previous 36-month period prior to their DD214 transition date, any Soldier assessed as a tier level one, after completing the self-assessment and IIC may opt to decline participation in TAP. This is annotated during IIC for each successive period of 180 days or more of continuous active-duty service. When assessed as tier level two or three, Soldiers must complete all assigned CRS requirements.


5. Career Skills Program (CSP).

a. CSP, also known as DoD SkillBridge program, affords transitioning Soldiers within 180 days from their transition date, the opportunity to participate in apprenticeships, on-the-job training (OJT), employment skills training (EST), and internships with command approval IAW DoDI 1322.29 (JTEST-AI) and AR 600-81. The submission of a PAR in IPPS-A with a request to retire or separate is sufficient for determination of the 180-day eligibility with Commander approval to participate. The priority of attendance generally falls into the below categories:
Tier 3 Soldiers
18 to 24 years old
First-term enlistments
Involuntarily separating due to force shaping
Rapid separation from AD
Acquisition of disabilities that result in medical separations, subject to CSP provider qualifications determination.

(1) Approval authority is granted to HQDA G-1 for all providers requesting to partner with the Career Skills Program requiring 121 days or more to complete. This includes Individual Internships and all approved DoD Skillbridge programs. Delegation of authority to The Adjutant General (TAG) is authorized.

(2) Approval Authority is granted to the Commander, IMCOM for all providers requesting to partner with the Career Skills Program requiring 120 or less to complete. Delegation of authority to IMCOM G-1 is authorized; no further delegation is authorized.

(3) Approval authority for Soldiers participation in a Career Skills Program or DoD Skillbridge program remains IAW AR 600-81.

(4) Commanders must assess their unit readiness and mission requirements to determine the level of risk for approving a Soldier’s participation.

(5) An administrative absence, not to exceed 180 days, may be authorized for participation. Refer to AR 600-8-10 for approval and administrative processing of all administrative absences.

(6) Soldiers attending an on-installation program, or an off-installation program geographically co-located within a 50-mile radius from their current duty station, must do so in a “Present for Duty” (PDY) duty status.

(7) Soldiers attending a program located beyond a 50-mile radius from their current duty station, must do so in an “Administrative Absence” (AA) duty status.

(8) Commanders will establish daily personnel accountability procedures for Soldiers authorized to participate. Commanders may also revoke authorization to participate at any time during the program based on unit mission requirements.

(9) Planning must include sufficient time after completion to return to your permanent duty station to complete physical and administrative out-processing requirements in accordance with AR 600–8–101, to include unit-level and installation level out-processing and final out before a separation or retirement date.

(10) Soldiers enrolled into IDES or assigned to a Soldier Recovery Unit (SRU) may begin immediately following their Medical Retention Determination Point (MRDP) upon authorization. Soldiers assigned to a SRU no longer have to wait 85 days to begin once their MRDP is established due to the possibility of a separation date being determined that would not allow the Soldier the opportunity to participate in the program.

(11) Commanders may assign qualified Soldiers participating in a program to excess positions (known loss) in IPPS-A, to make military positions available for fill-by-replacement personnel on the modified table of organization and equipment or the table of distribution and allowances authorization documents.

(12) Internships are authorized in Federal, State, local government or in the private sector (either for-profit or not-for-profit). Internships cannot be utilized to work on Capitol Hill in any capacity. The Defense Fellows Program manages all internships on Capitol Hill. 


6. Special Instructions for Reserve Component Personnel Mobilizing on Title 10 Orders over 180 Days.

a. ARNG and USAR Soldiers serving 180 continuous days or more on active duty pursuant to Title 10 must complete the TAP process before the separation date on their DD Form 214. Soldiers serving on active duty pursuant to Title 10 for training and professional education are not required to complete TAP. As an exception, Title 32 AGR Soldiers returning from, Title 10 status, are not required to complete all mandated TAP CRS components if they can provide proof of their Title 32 AGR status. Completion of the Enterprise Individualized Self-Assessment (EISA) and Individualized Initial Counseling (IIC) will identify the Title 32 AGR status and the counselor will enter this information into the TAP database.

b. Reserve component Soldiers with more than 180 days of continuous service should complete the self-assessment and IIC during pre-mobilization, initial mobilization, or as soon as possible thereafter.

c. Soldiers deployed to an austere environment may conduct a telephone or VC (non-video) initial counseling session if sufficient equipment or bandwidth is not available to support video counseling.

d. Procedures: In order to comply with National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) mandated timelines and to minimize requirements during demobilization processes, RC units will follow the steps below:

(1) Upon identification for mobilization/activation, unit command will submit a telephonic mission request in order to complete the Self-Assessment and Individualized Initial Counseling (IIC) prior to deployment.

(2) Mission requests will include a unit roster with a by-name list of all Soldiers and their SSN/DODID. Units must also identify a POC for coordination and accountability. Upon mission approval, U.S. Army Human Resources Command, Transition Division will provide units with appointment times and phone numbers for Soldiers to call or log-in times with the Forward Transition Support Team (FTST).

(3) Upon completion of the IIC, an FTST is assigned to complete these telephonic missions.

(4) The counselor will assign a tier level to each Soldier and identify the required legal and CRS requirements. Upon completion of the Self-Assessment and IIC, Soldiers can initiate the Pre-Separation Counseling.

(5) Units have four options for completion of the required Pre-Separation Counseling.

(a) Units with an approved Yellow Ribbon Event (YRE) will ensure all assigned/attached Soldiers complete the Pre-Separation Counseling and Financial Planning Brief during the YRE provided by a FTST.

(b) Units without an approved YRE that are mobilizing/activating will ensure all assigned/attached Soldiers complete the Pre-Separation Counseling while at the mobilization site.

(c) Units that did not request a YRE or are individual augmentees will utilize the FTSTs at the mobilization station or TAP Virtual Center (VC) to complete TAP requirements.

(d) Units or individual augmentees located within 50 miles of a TAP center are authorized to complete TAP requirements at that installation. No travel costs or per diem are authorized for Soldiers utilizing the installation TAP center. Soldiers are required to provide deployment orders to receive services.

(6) Completion of all other legal/CRS requirements are subsequently completed throughout mobilization utilizing the FTST counselors at a demobilization site or through the TAP VC. Allowing Soldiers to complete requirements during mobilization/activation will shorten the TAP requirements during the demobilization process. Soldiers required to complete all requirements during DEMOB can expect a full week of TAP curriculum.

(7) A capstone event is completed in person or telephonically utilizing the demobilization site or through the TAP VC.

e. Reporting Capabilities: All reports for TAP compliance and timeliness are recorded in the TAP-XXI database. TAP Counselors are the responsible agent for ensuring completion data is entered into each Soldier’s TAP-XXI record.

7. Warm Handover is a capstone process between the Army and appropriate interagency partners, resulting in the person-to-person mandatory connection of personnel. Soldiers who do not meet CRS and/or do not have a viable Individual Transition Plan (ITP) are eligible to receive services and follow-up resources as needed. The Warm Handover entails a confirmed introduction and assurance that the appropriate inter-agency partner(s) acknowledge that Army personnel require post-military assistance and are willing to follow through on providing assistance to meet their needs and assist them in attaining their CRS and ultimately a successful transition.

a. The commander or commander’s designee determine whether personnel assigned to their command completed a viable ITP and met CRS requirements. The commander will receive a digital token, from the TAP center, to review and sign the DD Form 2648 (eForm). If the commander determines CRS requirements were not met, neither a viable ITP completed, nor adequate post-transition transportation or a housing plan is in place, or additional peer support is necessary, then the commander must confirm that the Warm Handover takes place with the appropriate interagency partner(s) prior to the issuance of the DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty). The commander will annotate what type of Warm Handover is necessary in the comments on the eForm and send it back to the TAP counselor.

b. In the event all CRS requirements are complete and an individual would like additional services after they transition, a Warm Handover is available to them. 

c. Transition Assistance Program counselors will annotate a Warm Handover on the DD Form 2648 (eForm). A counselor will only annotate a Warm Handover on the eForm if the client has not completed applicable CRS, provided a viable ITP, does not have an adequate post-transition transportation or housing plan in place, and/or they need further transition assistance support, including peer support.

(1) Select Warm Handover Type: VA, DOL or Military OneSource.

(2) Provide Warm Handover reason: Housing, Transportation, Employment, Financial Readiness, Benefits, Medial/Healthcare, Education, Disability Claim, Peer Support or Other (Specify in Comments).

(3) Include Representative information: Name of representative, Building/Address, Email, Phone number, Organization (VA, DOL, Military OneSource, Vet Center, AJC, TAP Center or Education Center).

(4) Post-Transition Location: Where will the client transition or relocate. Provide address if possible.

(5) Comments: Always include a comment if you provide a Warm Handover. You should try to answer the 5 W’s in the comments if possible.
